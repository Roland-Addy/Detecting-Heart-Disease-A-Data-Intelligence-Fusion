## Problem Area
Heart and circulatory diseases is an umbrella term for all diseases of the heart and circulation. It includes everything from conditions that are inherited or that a person is born with, to those that develop later, such as coronary heart disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, stroke and vascular dementia. Globally itâ€™s estimated that 1 in 13 people are living with a heart or circulatory disease.

In the United States, one person dies every 33 seconds from heart disease. It is the leading cause of deaths for people in most racial and ethnic groups in the country. In 2021, one in every 5 deaths was due to a heart disease. Unsurprisingly, this cost the US government about $239.9 billion each year from 2018 to 2019, including the cost of health care services, medicines, and lost productivity due to death. Heart disease is the leading cause of death for people of most racial and ethnic groups in the United States, including African American, American Indian, Alaska Native, Hispanic, and white men. For women from the Pacific Islands and Asian American, American Indian, Alaska Native, and Hispanic women, heart disease is second only to cancer.

Below are the percentages of all deaths caused by heart disease in 2021, listed by ethnicity, race, and sex:
| Race of Ethnic Group                     | % of Deaths | 
|:------------|:--------------|
| American Indian or Alaska Native         | 15.5        | 
| Asian                                    | 18.6        | 
| Black (Non-Hispanic)                     | 22.6        | 
| Native Hawaiin or Other Pacific Islander | 18.3        | 
| White (Non-Hispanic)                     | 18.0        | 
| Hispanic                                 | 11.9        | 
| All	                                     | 17.4        | 


The most common heart disease is 'Coronary Artery Disease which killed 375,476 people in 2021. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 1 in 20 adults age 20 and older have Coronary Artery Disease, to put that into perspective, that is about 5% of adults age 20 and older. In 2021, about 2 in 10 deaths from Coronary Artery Disease, happen in adults less than 65 years old. Coronary heart disease can lead to a heart attack.

In the United States, someone has a heart attack every 40 seconds and every year about 805,000 people in the United States have a heart attack. Of these, 605,000 are a first heart attack. About 1 in 5 heart attacks are silent which means, the damage is done but the person is not aware of it. 

## Proposed Data Science Solution
High blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and smoking are key risk factors for heart disease. Among these, several other medical conditions and lifestyle choices can also put people at a higher risk for heart disease. In healthcare, identifying and preventing the factors that have the greatest impact on heart disease is very important. Advances in technology have allowed the application of machine learning methods to detect "patterns" in the data, using theses risk factors, that can predict a patient's condition or propensity to develop a heart disease.

This project seeks to apply machine learning techniques on a 2022 annual CDC survey data, of 400k+ adults related to their health status, to predict an individual's propensity to a heart attack. The original dataset of nearly 300 variables was reduced to 40variables. An the ultimate goal of this project is to apply a number of machine learning methods, especially classifier models (logistic regression, SVM, random forest, etc.) to help make predictions of heart attacks.
