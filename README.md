## Problem Area
In the United States, one person dies every 33 seconds from heart disease. It is the leading cause of deaths for people in most racial and ethnic groups in the country. In 2021, one in every 5 deaths was due to a heart disease. Unsurprisingly, this cost the US government about $239.9 billion each year from 2018 to 2019, including the cost of health care services, medicines, and lost productivity due to death. Heart disease is the leading cause of death for people of most racial and ethnic groups in the United States, including African American, American Indian, Alaska Native, Hispanic, and white men. For women from the Pacific Islands and Asian American, American Indian, Alaska Native, and Hispanic women, heart disease is second only to cancer.

Below are the percentages of all deaths caused by heart disease in 2021, listed by ethnicity, race, and sex:
| Race of Ethnic Group                     | % of Deaths | 
|:------------|:--------------|
| American Indian or Alaska Native         | 15.5        | 
| Asian                                    | 18.6        | 
| Black (Non-Hispanic)                     | 22.6        | 
| Native Hawaiin or Other Pacific Islander | 18.3        | 
| White (Non-Hispanic)                     | 18.0        | 
| Hispanic                                 | 11.9        | 
| All	                                     | 17.4        | 


The most common heart disease is 'Coronary Artery Disease which killed 375,476 people in 2021. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 1 in 20 adults age 20 and older have Coronary Artery Disease, to put that into perspective, that is about 5% of adults age 20 and older. In 2021, about 2 in 10 deaths from Coronary Artery Disease, happen in adults less than 65 years old

In the United States, someone has a heart attack every 40 seconds and every year about 805,000 people in the United States have a heart attack. Of these, 605,000 are a first heart attack. About 1 in 5 heart attacks are silent which means, the damage is done but the person is not aware of it.
